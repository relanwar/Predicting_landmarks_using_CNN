# Predicting_landmarks_using_CNN
This project (nd101-c2-landmarks-starter) is about using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module to build a landmark classifier. The model should automatically be able to predict the location of the image based on any landmarks depicted in the image. This project is the second requirement to graduate from Udacity's Deep learning Nano-degree.
